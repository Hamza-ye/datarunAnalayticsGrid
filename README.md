# Datarun Analytics Grid

A front-end component for exploring analytics data from the **Datarun platform**.  
It provides a table and pivot-grid interface powered by the `/api/v1/analytics` endpoints.

## 1. Features

- Fetches metadata dynamically to build field pickers
- Query builder for dimensions, measures, filters, and sorts
- Table mode (`TABLE_ROWS`) and Pivot mode (`PIVOT_MATRIX`)
- Interactive features: filtering, sorting, pagination
- Advanced UX: drill-downs, saved views, guided analytics hints
- Strong error handling with UI feedback

### Roadmap, and guides

- **Datarun Analytics API Guide**: [api-guide/datarun-analytics-api-guide.md](api-guide/datarun-analytics-api-guide.md).
- **Datarun Angular Analytics Grid â€” Prioritized MVP Plan**: [api-guide/mvp-plan.md](api-guide/mvp-plan.md).

### Integration

This module is designed to slot into the broader **Datarun** system.  
All queries and metadata come from the analytics API: `/api/v1/analytics`.

## Project Structure

### Development

The build system will install automatically the recommended version of Node and npm.

We provide a wrapper to launch npm.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
./npmw install
```

The system use npm scripts and [Angular CLI][] with [Webpack][] as the build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./npmw start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `./npmw update` and `./npmw install` to
manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `./npmw help update`.

The `./npmw run` command will list all the scripts available to run for this project.

#### PWA Support

The System is shipped with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and currently turned off.

The service worker initialization code is disabled. To enable it, uncomment the following code in
`src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts`:

```typescript
ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false }),
```

#### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

```
./npmw install --save --save-exact leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, run following command:

```
./npmw install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet
```

Then import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts](src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss](src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss) file:

```
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

#### Using Angular CLI

To use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

```
ng generate component my-component
```

will generate few files:

```
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
update src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts
```

### Quick notes â€” key structure points

- **Top-level config**

  - `angular.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `package.json` and `README.md` hold the workspace and build settings.

- **Build layer (`webpack/`)**

  - Custom webpack config and proxy live here. `proxy.conf.js` is commonly used for local API proxies;
    `webpack.custom.js` is for any bespoke build tweaks.

- **Entry points**

  - `src/main/webapp/main.ts` and `index.html` are the Angular application entry. `main.ts` bootstraps the app.

- **App root (`app/`)**

  - `app.component.ts`, `app.config.ts`, `app.routes.ts`, and `app-page-title-strategy.ts` define global wiring: root
    component, application-level configuration, routes, and title strategy.

- **Core module (`app/core`)**

  - **Auth**: `auth.service.ts`, `state-storage.service.ts`, `account.service.ts`, auth logic centralized here.
  - **Interceptors**: `auth.interceptor`, `auth-expired.interceptor`, `error-handler.interceptor`, and
    `notification.interceptor` handle cross-cutting HTTP concerns.
  - **Utils**: shared services (alerts, parsing links, event manager) used across the app.

- **App-level `config/`**

  - Central constants and adapters (date handling, pagination, icons, input constants) live under `app/config`..

- **Environments**

  - `environments/environment*.ts` define dev/production flags and endpoints.

- **Layouts & Routing**

  - `layouts/main` contains the main layout; and the `router-outlet` of the app.
